My research interests lie broadly in Monte Carlo methods and stochastic differential equations and their applications to mathematical finance and economics. 

I have previously worked with [Dr. Tomoyuki Ichiba](http://ichiba.faculty.pstat.ucsb.edu/) and [Dr. Alexander Shkolnik](https://cdar.berkeley.edu/people/alex-shkolnik) on research projects pertaining to Malliavin calculus and James-Stein estimation.

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have consistently typed up notes for many of the mathematics/statistics classes that I took. Here are a medley of them. I take full responsibility for any typos/mistakes that may be present in these notes - and I'm sure that there are many of them. Proceed with caution!

## Mathematics

### Analysis
This was a three-quarter sequence on undergraduate real analysis. MATH 118A covered most of Abbott's *Understanding Analysis*, MATH 118B covered most of Rudin's *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*, and MATH 118C some of Stein & Shakarchi's *Fourier Analysis* before we switched gears to Royden & Fitzpatrick's *Real Analysis*.

Hi there! I am a first year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Operations Research](stor.unc.edu) at the [University of Chicago](unc.edu). Prior to joining UChicago, I majored in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics at the [College of Creative Studies](ccs.ucsb.edu) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](ucsb.edu).
